The keypress events are generally the easiest to work with. It's not too hard to identify which key was pressed. You can get the character typed by doing: 

  if (event.which == null)
     char= String.fromCharCode(event.keyCode);    // IE
  else if (event.which != 0 && event.charCode != 0)
     char= String.fromCharCode(event.which);	  // All others
  else
     // special key
